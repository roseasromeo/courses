\section{Accommodations and Adaptations}
[standard formal accommodation policy from the school here]
In addition to formal accommodations, course adaptations may be available. These can include: additional extension budget days for acute and/or ongoing mental, emotional, and physical health issues that not covered by formal accommodations; additional office hours that avoid overlap with work, childcare, or other obligations; alternate methods of earning participation credit for expected or unexpected absences; and other adaptations as needed. Please reach out to Red to talk to them about how to adapt the course to match your needs as a learner and a person, even if you don't yet know what the right adaptation is for you.

Course structure and deadlines are intended to help pace your learning and give ample time for feedback from instructors. If the course elements are inhibiting your ability to learn the material and develop your skills, we will work together to adapt to your needs.
