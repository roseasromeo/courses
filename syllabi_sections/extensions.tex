\section{Extensions}
Every student has a budget of 10 days of extensions, to be distributed as they want or need among the full term, no questions asked. If you expect to turn in an assignment more than 5 days past its due date, please let Red know so they can ensure you have support for finishing the assignment (i.e. so they can schedule additional office hours). If you know that you will consistently need an additional day to complete work (ex. other classes have the same weekly homework deadline), also please let Red know--you are likely not alone in that having that issue.

In addition to the budgeted 10 days, please see the Accomodations and Adaptations policy below for details on how to seek additional extensions and other help.
